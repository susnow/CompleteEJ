end up on the bottom of the file. Any objections? Comments on here and we can
work out how to write in the TODO file. ;) - vladinator

The world bosses thing, the only "issue" is that the dungeons (i.e. zone/map)
wouldn't allow you to see blobs of the bosses on the map, unless we make one
"instance" per continent. I think it would look nicer with one "World Bosses"
instance with all the bosses under it, or perhaps "World Bosses: <Expansion>"
tough I think just plain "World Bosses" may be fine since you only got Outland
and Cataclysm, to my knowledge... none in Wotlk right?
Not a big deal, just nice if we try keep it Blizzard-like I guess.
(The huge bar with "----" is just so we make new line properly, so text is
readable without wrapping the lines, hehe.)
The only issue for now is, I got Photoshop templates that I worked out for
the images, but not sure if Photoshop is the best way, what image editors do
you use?

Made a checklist, don't know completion rate of those though. So people should
remove it from the list or something :p
For the worlf bosses "issue". Why not make a folder "Misc" or so and store it
in there? Or leave it in the root. I will start on Wotlk (top of the checklist)

There is a strange texture issue now, for no reason, in the tga it works fine
but in the blp files the right edge is supposed to be hidden but it's visible
when looking at an encounter. need to try and find a better tga>blp converter
or try to fix this somehow, the blp seem fine when I look at them in a viewer
so I am not sure why this happened.

#vladinator
If you like I can put the tools I used to make the tga into working blp in some
other SVN directory, along with some templates if you like to use them -saves
you time. but what folder should I put those in?

Finishes Blackfathom Deeps, doing Gnomeregan and Scarlet Monastery after it.

Needs to put "world_bosses.lua" into the right category, I guess under raids
and have either one for all expansions or split it up, one world boss file per
expansion, not sure what is the best course of action right now. In any case,
going to work with Blackfathom Deeps then Gnomeregan, just so you know.
